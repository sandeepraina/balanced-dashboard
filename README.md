The Balanced Dashboard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balanced/balanced-dashboard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balanced/balanced-dashboard)

## What

Welcome to the Balanced Dashboard.

As an open company we want to put as much of our company in the public view as
possible. We're creating our new dashboard as a javascript application that
anyone can fork, comment on, contribute to, or generally tinker with.

## Why

Found a spelling mistake? Want to run your own version with customised
functionality? Jump in and contribute!

## How

### Running locally

You will need node installed as a development dependency. See
[node's site](http://nodejs.org/) for help with that.

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. `npm install`
3. Build - `grunt`
4. To view in a browser - [http://localhost:9876/build/dev.html](http://localhost:9876/build/dev.html)
5. To run unit tests at the command line `grunt test`
6. To run unit tests in a browser - [http://localhost:9876/build/test/runner.html](http://localhost:9876/build/test/runner.html)
7. To browser the dashboard running against test fixture data - [http://localhost:9876/build/test/fixturebrowser.html](http://localhost:9876/build/test/fixturebrowser.html)
8. To run browser tests `grunt itest`

### Building and Deploying

1. To build everything `grunt build`
2. To deploy to S3 `grunt deploy`

**Note**: To build, you need to have binary dependendencies installed for [grunt-img](https://github.com/heldr/grunt-img). See the project page for how to set that up. If you have a Mac and use homebrew, you can run this to install them:

		brew install optipng jpeg

**Note**: In order to deploy to S3, you must have the appropriate `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables set

### Contributing

You can contribute to this project in one of two ways:

1. Browse our issues, comment on proposals, report bugs.
2. Clone the balanced-dashboard repo, make some changes according to our
   development guidelines and issue a pull-request with your changes.

Not sure where to start? Look for issues tagged [`n00b`](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-dashboard/issues?labels=n00b&state=open), these are tasks
that should be able to be completed in an hour or two and require minimal
knowledge of the balanced-dashboard application.

### Development guidelines

1. Fork it (`git clone git://github.com/balanced/balanced-dashboard.git`)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Write your code **and unit tests**
4. Ensure all tests still pass (`grunt test`)
5. Ensure that your new code has test coverage (check out report/coverage/index.html after running tests)
6. Verify your code your code (`grunt verify`) (uses [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) and [JSBeautify](https://github.com/einars/js-beautify) to do linting and check style guidelines)
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
8. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
9. Create new [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
