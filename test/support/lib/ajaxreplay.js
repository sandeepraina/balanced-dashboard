// If you prefer to use live api calls in your javascript based tests, Ajax Replay is for you.  (Also, it can be a real simple caching layer for a web app if you are only doing reads.)  Philosophically I prefer to use live api data in my tests so that if the api responses change I can still rest assured that my application will continue to work.  Ideally api responses shouldn't change, but in the real world that is seldom the case.  Accidents happen.

// Ajax Replay is a simple way to allow you to use real api calls in your tests/specs, without paying the performance penalty.  If you are familiar with **[vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)** for ruby, this is similar, but completely javascript/front end based.  Once Ajax Replay is loaded it takes over XMLHttpRequest and from then on will automatically cache all ajax calls and responses into localstorage.  Subsequent ajax calls that match the same method+url+params will immediately respond with the stored response.

// So in short, the first time you run a test it will hit the live server you were calling, but after that all responses are local and really fast.  What you might expect to see is that the first time running a test suite a particular test might take a few seconds (depending on api server response speed), but subsequent runs will take only milliseconds.

// This implementation is test harness agnostic.  I prefer **[jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)** as a test suite, but Ajax Replay doesn't care if you use jasmine or not.  The only requirement is that you load Ajax Replay before any other libraries get a hold on the XMLHttpRequest object.  In practice this means making sure that Ajax Replay is the first script load, or if you use require.js, make sure that jquery or underscore or ... have a dependency on Ajax Replay.

// We're leaving around one itsy bitsy global ajaxReplay object.  This is done intentionally, so don't yell at me about keeping global clean.

var ajaxReplay = (function() {
	var ajaxReplay = {

		// If you want to disable Ajax Replay for some ajax calls, just set noCache to true.  When you are ready for caching again, set it back to false.
		noCache: false,

		// By default Ajax Replay will always respond from cache, and THEN send off the original api call so that the local cache can get refreshed.  The cache response happens first, and quickly, so you still get a super fast response but you have the advantage of always getting your cache up to date.  It's a win/win.  If you don't want any sneaking api calls going out the back end then set refresh to false.

We'll just store that info for later use.  At this point, no network calls have been initiated, so we do nothing.

When there are lots of little items, the browser will crawl.  If you start noticing this, you probably will want to clear LocalStorage out (*ajaxReplay.clearCache()*).  The cache has no expiration date associated with each item, so they are stored permanently.
